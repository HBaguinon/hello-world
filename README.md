# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository which follows the "Hello World" tradition. Hello World!

I like Java and C++, but I'm expanding my knowledge of Python, Scala, Ruby, Angular, Rails, JS, and Go!
I'm surprisingly well-rounded, with backgrounds in project management, business analysis, cybersecurity, networking, international education, database administration, and software development.
